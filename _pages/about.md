A Bit About Me 
======
I’m a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Houston with a strong interest in software development and problem-solving. I enjoy learning how systems work, improving my coding skills, and turning ideas into practical solutions.

Alongside my studies, I work in a leadership role as a shift supervisor at Starbucks, where I've developed communication, team management, and decision-making skills in a fast-paced environment. I bring that same responsibility and focus into my technical work and projects.

I’m actively seeking opportunities to grow as a software developer and contribute to real-world projects.
