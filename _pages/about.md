A Bit About Me 
======
I’m a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Houston. I'm passionate about building software that is both functional and meaningful. I enjoy working on problem-solving projects, learning new technologies, and collaborating with others. I currently work as a shift supervisor at Starbucks. With this leadership experience, I’ve developed strong communication and team management skills that complement my technical background.
